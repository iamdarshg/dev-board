# Production handoff

## Release artifacts

- PCB: `dev-real-production.kicad_pcb`
- KiCad project rules: `dev-real-production.kicad_pro`
- Fabrication archive: `dev-real-production-fab.zip`
- DRC report: `dev-real-production-drc.rpt`
- Detailed pair audit: `dev-real-production-length-audit.txt`

The final KiCad 9 DRC result is **0 violations, 0 unconnected pads, and 0 footprint errors** at error severity.

## ADC/DAC test breakout

The exposed 1.0 mm test pads are grouped on the bottom edge at 2.0 mm pitch:

| Reference | Net | Position (mm) |
|---|---|---:|
| TP8 | ADC VIN+ | 79, 11 |
| TP9 | ADC VIN- | 81, 11 |
| TP1 | DAC red / AR | 83, 11 |
| TP2 | DAC green / AG | 85, 11 |
| TP3 | DAC blue / AB | 87, 11 |

ADC test-branch mismatch is 0.509 mm. These are measurement branches; keep probes and flying leads short.

## Pair-length audit

Key routed mismatches:

| Pair | End-to-end mismatch |
|---|---:|
| ADC analog input | 0.072 mm |
| ADC sample clock | 0.572 mm |
| Ethernet RX | 0.260 mm |
| Ethernet TX | 3.723 mm |
| STM32 USB FS | 5.049 mm |
| MM8108 USB | 7.819 mm |
| RP2350 USB | 9.702 mm |
| FTDI USB | 16.235 mm |

The dense USB routes were not given forced serpentine sections because no collision-free tuning corridor was available. The STM32, RP2350, and FTDI paths are identified as full-speed USB in this design and are retained as routed. Confirm the MM8108 interface speed before fabrication: if it operates at USB high speed, its 7.819 mm residual mismatch should be rerouted against the module's timing requirement.

## Fabricator instructions

- Four copper layers, nominal finished thickness 1.6 mm.
- The board contains F.Cu-to-In1.Cu laser microvias and In1.Cu-to-In2.Cu buried vias. Use an HDI process capable of the separated drill sets supplied in the archive.
- Confirm the smallest finished drill, annular ring, stacked-via policy, via filling/capping, soldermask expansion, and copper-to-edge limits against the KiCad board before accepting the order.
- Differential impedance must be field-solved by the selected fabricator using its actual laminate and plating data. Do not treat the nominal KiCad geometry as an impedance coupon.
- The project says only `Lead-Free` for copper finish; select the required finish explicitly on the fabrication purchase order.
